<!--       because we used the this keyword on the LandingCtrl's $scope, herotitle is now a property on the LandingCtrl's $scope object (meaning it's $scope contains the model, data, that the view will present to the template at the point in the DOM where the controller is registered).  The LandingCtrl for BlocJams is registered for the landing.html template.-->
