<!-- Despite using jQuery, Angular still dictates the style of our code â€“ we declare in the HTML which element should execute scope.onClickSeekBar().  When a user clicks on a point on the seek-bar class element, the function will execute -->

<!-- event (passed in from the view as $event) occurred -->

<div class="seek-bar" ng-click="onClickSeekBar($event)">
     <div class="fill" ng-style="fillStyle()"></div>
     <div class="thumb" ng-mousedown="trackThumb()" ng-style="thumbStyle()"></div>
 </div>

<!--ngStyle directive allows us to set CSS styles on an HTML element conditionally-->

<!-- The scope.trackThumb function should execute when a user interacts with the thumb class element in the view. More specifically, when the event is a mousedown event. Add an ngMousedown directive, which allows us to specify custom behavior on a mousedown event, to trigger the scope.trackThumb function -->
